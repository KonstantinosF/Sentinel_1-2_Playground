# Sentinel_1-2_Playground
In this repository I am sharing a pipeline I have created to ingest, preprocess and finaly create an analysis ready products based on Sentinel 1 GRD images.
The repo is consited of 3 folders. The firts one contains a jupyter notebook and the custom main futions in order to create a list of available Sentinel 1 images and then download them on our local machine. The second folder contain a jupyter noteboon as the main body of the code and the output is a new Sentinel 1 image preprocess and cleaned. The last folder contains the code files which create the final product of the project. The result is a binary image seperating water from background. The project has been build in python making use of modules like Snappy, GDAL, SentinelSat and Folium.
