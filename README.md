# Sentinel_1-2_Water_Mapping
In this repository I am sharing a pipeline I have created to ingest, preprocess and finaly create an analysis ready products based on Sentinel 1 GRD images.
The repo is consited of 2 folders. The firts one contains a jupyter notebook and a set of custom futions in order to create a list of available Sentinel 1 images and then download them on our local machine. The second folder contains a jupyter noteboon as the main body of the code and the output is a new image preprocess and cleaned indicating where water is. The result is a binary image seperating water from background. The project has been build in python making use of modules like Snappy, GDAL, SentinelSat and Folium.

This project experiments in water mapping using Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 1 data either separately or synergistically. <b>On Going Project </b>
